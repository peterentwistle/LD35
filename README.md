# LD35 - Theme: Shapeshift
My Ludum Dare #35 Entry

This is not a complete game.
I may continue building this after the competition is over, but a lot of things will be changed from the original idea.

Below is a list of the original idea and features the game would have.
Only a few of the features were implemented during the 48 hour compo.

## Original Features list

- Build defences to defend against attacking shapeshifting enemies - Must

- Enemies shift into more powerful versions until you eliminate them - Must
